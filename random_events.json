    "description": "[actor_0:full]は、彼女の数々の要求と個人的な好みのために、管理するのに苦労することがあります。ブラジャーをつけることは自然な生活と相容れないという彼女の考えもそのひとつです。\n\nRecently, a well known sports wear company has expressed interest in having her model their new line, including a live promotion event, for [yen]200000. However, this would include a number of loose fitting tops. [actor_0] is excited about the opportunity, but unwilling to compromise on the bra situation.\n\nYou could let her do it anyway and risk a scandal. Another option would be to offer to send [actor_1:full] instead, though that probably wouldn't sit well with [actor_0].\n\nWhat will you do?",

Unsurprisingly, she's become an expert very quickly.\n\nNow she's eager to share her work at a local art gallery. The event features local body painters doing live painting demostrations of their skill as they transform their own bodies into works of art. It also means that they begin with a \"blank canvas,\" in other words entirely nude. Needless to say, you have some reservations about allowing [actor_0] to perform in this capacity, though it would certainly excite her fans.\n\nYou've checked with the art studio and there are a few alternate options. She could wear nude colored panties and pasties as some of the other artists will be doing. Or you could insist that she find a model to paint instead of her own body. She'll probably be disappointed if you hold her back, but you also have to consider the repuatation of [groupname].\n\nWhat is your decision?",
